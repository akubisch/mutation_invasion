In the folder 'program/' there is the file 'run.R', which, when executed, performs the simulations and stores the results files in 'results/' in this folder. Afterwards, running 'average_matrices.R' summarizes the runs and creates the data to plot, which will be graphed by 'figures_paper.R'.

To keep this repo in a sensible size, the raw results files are not uploaded, but the processed ones are.
